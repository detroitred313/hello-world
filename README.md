# hello-world
New to web dev so bare with me please
I am completely new to the web developement world.  Never gave this a thought until one day I did some research on it.  I did a couple courses on codeacademy andfell in love with it. I plan on making this a career. I am 36 years old and have been in the automotive manufacturing industry since 2006.  Prior to that I served in the United States Marine Corps for 6 years.
